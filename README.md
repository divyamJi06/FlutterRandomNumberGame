What this Flutter app is all about:

Random Number Game is a small game in which the computer generates a random 4 digit number.
You have to guess the number in 5 attempts.
You will be told when the digits when the digit is correct or wrong or rightly placed.

I have also added a QR Scanner which will detect and give the QR results.

Add your flutter game and I would love to commit.
